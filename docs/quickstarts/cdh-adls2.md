Use this quickstart if you want to configure Fusion to connect to Cloudera (CDH) and ADLS Gen2 storage.

## Limitations of this quickstart

* This guide does not currently offer configuration of Fusion to a **Kerberized** CDH cluster.
* Migration of existing data will be available after configuration, but not live replication.

We are working to include these additional items as soon as possible.

## Prerequisites

* Azure VM instance set up and running, with root access available (instructions were tested on RHEL 7).
* Docker (v19.03.3 or higher), Docker Compose (v1.24.1 or higher), and Git installed on instance.
* Administrator credentials for the Cloudera Manager.
* Network connectivity to the Cloudera Manager.
* Credentials for accessing the Data Lake Storage Gen2.
* Network connectivity to the Data Lake Storage Gen2.

## Guidance

Clone the Fusion docker repository to your Azure VM instance:

`$ git clone https://github.com/WANdisco/fusion-docker-compose.git`

Switch to the repository directory, and run the setup script:

`cd fusion-docker-compose`

`./setup-env.sh`

Follow the prompts to configure your zones.

### Setup prompts

_Zone name_

If defining a zone name, please note that each zone must have a different name (i.e. they cannot match).

_Licenses_

Trial licenses will last 30 days and are limited to 1TB of replicated data.

_Example entries for CDH_

Hadoop NameNode IP/hostname: `namenode.example.com` - if NameNode HA is configured, this should be the Active NameNode.

NameNode port: `8020` - if NameNode HA is configured, this value will be defined in the `dfs.namenode.rpc-address.<nameservice>.<namenode_id>` property. If NameNode HA is not configured, the value will be defined in the `fs.defaultFS` property.

_Example entries for ADLS Gen2_

Storage account: `adlsg2storage`

Storage container: `fusionreplication`

Account key: `RANDOM_STRING` - the Primary Access Key is now referred to as Key1 in Microsoftâ€™s documentation. You can get the KEY from the Microsoft Azure storage account.

default FS: `abfss://fusionreplication@adlsg2storage.dfs.core.windows.net/`

underlying FS: `abfs://fusionreplication@adlsg2storage.dfs.core.windows.net/`

### Startup

After all the prompts have been completed, you will be able to start the containers.

Ensure that Docker is started:

`systemctl status docker`

If not, start the Docker service:

`systemctl start docker`

Start the Fusion containers with:

`docker-compose up -d`

Log into the ONEUI via a web browser with the VM's hostname and port 8080.

`http://<docker_hostname>:8081/`

Register your email address and password, and then use these to log into the ONEUI.

### Replication

_You now have the ability to create replication rules via the ONEUI, feel free to create one and test replication._

## Useful docker-compose commands

Bring down containers and retain configured state:

`docker-compose down`

Remove all named volumes and down containers (current configuration will be lost):

`docker-compose down -v`

## Useful docker commands

List all running containers:

`docker ps`

Log into specific container:

`docker exec -it <container-ID> /bin/bash`

Stop all containers:

`docker container stop $(docker container ls -aq)`

Remove all stopped containers, all networks not used by at least one container, all dangling images and all dangling build cache:

`docker system prune`

## Information on service names

The Fusion service names can be found in the `.yml` files contained within the `fusion-docker-compose` Git repository.

_Example_
```text
docker-compose.zone-a.yml
docker-compose.common.yml
```
For instance, the ONEUI service is not required in a specific zone, so the service name can be found inside of the `docker-compose.common.yml` file.

`vi docker-compose.common.yml`

```text
# This service creates the One UI Server component to manage both zones.
#
# Note: this component can be run in either zone, so one is chosen arbitrarily

  # Fusion OneUI Server
  fusion-oneui-server:
```

Restart the ONEUI service:

`docker-compose up -d --force fusion-oneui-server`

## Troubleshooting

In the event that you need to rebuild your Fusion environment, firstly log into the ONEUI container and delete the H2 database for ONEUI.

This is required because the data stored there is not cleaned up when pruning the existing containers, and will still contain information regarding the previous ecosystem.

Obtain the ONEUI container ID:

`docker ps | grep oneui`

Log into the ONEUI container and delete the H2 database for ONEUI:

`docker exec -it <ONEUI-container-ID> /bin/bash`

`rm -rf /h2db/db`

`exit`

You should then `docker container stop $(docker container ls -aq)` and `docker system prune` all existing containers.

If you wanting to run through the setup script with prompts again, you must remove all of the `.yml` and `.env` files that were created after the setup:

`rm -f common.env zone_a.env zone_b.env docker-compose.zone-a.yml docker-compose.zone-b.yml docker-compose.common.yml`
