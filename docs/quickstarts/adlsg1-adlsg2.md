Use this quickstart if you want to configure Fusion to connect ADLS Gen1 storage and ADLS Gen2 storage.

## Prerequisites

* Azure VM instance set up and running, with root access available (instructions were tested on RHEL 7).
* Docker (v19.03.3 or higher), Docker Compose (v1.24.1 or higher), and Git installed on instance.
* Credentials for accessing the Data Lake Storage Gen1 and Data Lake Storage Gen2.
* Network connectivity between Azure VM and Data Lake Storage Gen1/Gen2.

## Guidance

Clone the Fusion docker repository to your Azure VM instance:

`$ git clone https://github.com/WANdisco/fusion-docker-compose.git`

Switch to the repository directory, and run the setup script:

`cd fusion-docker-compose`

`./setup-env.sh`

Follow the prompts to configure your zone(s):

```text
Please choose from one of the following zone types:

  cdh
  hdi-adls1
  hdi-adls2
  hdp
  s3

Enter the first zone type [Press enter for a list]: hdi-adls1
Enter the second zone type (or NONE to skip) [Press enter for a list]: hdi-adls2
Enter your license file path (or NONE for a trial): [NONE]: "Press enter for a trial license, or provide an absolute path to one on the filesystem."
Enter the UI external address for zone-a [fusion-ui.example.com]: "Enter the external hostname for the VM."
Enter the ADLS home hostname for zone-a [example.westeurope.azuredatalakestore.net]: "The ADLS Gen1 hostname to connect to."
Enter the ADLS home mountpoint for zone-a [/]: "The file path in the ADLS file system for Fusion to use as root."
Enter the ADL handshake user for zone-a: "The service principal name to be used to authenticate with the ADLS Gen1."
Enter the ADL OAUTH2 Credential for zone-a: "The authentication key of the Active Directory credential you wish to use with Fusion."
Enter the ADL OAUTH2 Refresh URL for zone-a [https://login.microsoftonline.com/example/oauth2/token]: "The Refresh Token URL for the account."
Enter the ADL OAUTH2 Client ID for zone-a: "The full client ID of the Active Directory credential you wish to use with Fusion."
Enter the UI external address for zone-b [fusion-ui.example.com]: "Enter the external hostname for the VM (this can be the same as for zone-a)."
Enter the Azure storage account name for zone-b: "The name of the ADLS Gen2 storage account.""
Enter the Azure storage container for zone-b: "The blob container that should be used."
Enter the Azure account key for zone-b: "The Primary Access Key is now referred to as Key1 in Microsoftâ€™s documentation. You can get the KEY from the Microsoft Azure storage account."
Enter the default FS for zone-b [abfss://<storage-container>@<storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net/]: "Leave blank as default is okay to use here"
Enter the underlying FS for zone-b [abfs://<storage-container>@<storage-account>.dfs.core.windows.net/]: "Leave blank as default is okay to use here"
```

After all the prompts have been completed, the following text will appear:

```text
The environment has now been configured. You can run:
  docker-compose up -d
to start the Fusion containers.
Once Fusion starts browse to http://<zone-a.external.address>:8080 to access the UI.
```

Ensure that Docker is started:

`systemctl status docker`

If not, start the Docker service:

`systemctl start docker`

Start the Fusion containers with:

`docker-compose up -d`

Log into the ONEUI via a web browser with the VM's hostname and port 8080.

_Example_

`http://<hostname>:8080/`

Register your email address and password, and then use these to log into the ONEUI.

_You now have the ability to create replication rules via the ONEUI, feel free to create one and test replication._

## Useful docker commands

Stop all containers:

`docker container stop $(docker container ls -aq)`

Remove all stopped containers, all networks not used by at least one container, all dangling images and all dangling build cache:

`docker system prune`

List all running containers:

`docker ps`

Log into specific container:

`docker exec -it <container-ID> /bin/bash`

### Information on service names

The Fusion service names can be found in the `.yml` files contained within the `fusion-docker-compose` Git repository.

_Example_
```text
docker-compose.zone-a.yml
docker-compose.common.yml
```
For instance, the ONEUI service is not required in a specific zone, so the service name can be found inside of the `docker-compose.common.yml` file.

`vi docker-compose.common.yml`

```text
# This service creates the One UI Server component to manage both zones.
#
# Note: this component can be run in either zone, so one is chosen arbitrarily

  # Fusion OneUI Server
  fusion-oneui-server:
```

Restart the ONEUI service:

`docker-compose up -d --force fusion-oneui-server`

## Troubleshooting

In the event that you need to rebuild your Fusion environment, firstly log into the ONEUI container and delete the H2 database for ONEUI.

This is required because the data stored there is not cleaned up when pruning the existing containers, and will still contain information regarding the previous ecosystem.

Obtain the ONEUI container ID:

`docker ps | grep oneui`

Log into the ONEUI container and delete the H2 database for ONEUI:

`docker exec -it <ONEUI-container-ID> /bin/bash`

`rm -rf /h2db/db`

`exit`

You should then `docker container stop $(docker container ls -aq)` and `docker system prune` all existing containers.

If you wanting to run through the setup script with prompts again, you must remove all of the `.yml` and `.env` files that were created after the setup:

`rm -f common.env zone_a.env docker-compose.zone-a.yml docker-compose.common.yml`
